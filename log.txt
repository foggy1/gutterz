I just want to rant about going through this process so that I remember later what it was first like to work with databases.

I'm especially motivated to write about this given the absurdity of the thing that just happened to me.  After programming the initial add_a_comic method, SQL (via Ruby) threw a weird exception at me:
`bind_param': bind or column index out of range (SQLite3::RangeException)

The thing is, I had actually gone through pains to make sure that I had the same number of columns and arguments and that all of them were pointing to the right things.  Googling this exception led me to a bunch of folks who were confused about how to interpolate strings in order to pass them to SQL; some were confused about this generally, others were worried about SQL injection.  But having watched the very helpful video, I knew I was using the right method, and though apparently there's a #prepare method that is also helpful, I didn't think I needed it.

The one mistake I saw was that I forgot a comma in my enumeration of the columns in which to insert the values.  But upon trying the code again, it kept throwing the exception.  Long story short, I had forgotten that the original exception thrown was about the comma and that this was a NEW exception: an exception being thrown because the part of the method that was searching for foreign keys on a name basis was now grabbing MULTIPLE FOREIGN KEYS.  At least I knew the part of my program that added the individual pieces worked well.

Another thing is, though I'm not using rspec, thinking in terms of testability has been hugely impactful on my progress in this program.  After being stuck for a long time (mostly on planning out the data structure) I finally figured out where to start based on what I could easily test: the adding function.  I know what I want to put in (the data about the comic) and exactly what I'd like to read back as a result (an array of that data).  I didn't use rspec because I'm not using classes and I didn't want to fiddle around too much making dummy classes solely for the sake of doing testing.
