# gutterz
a comic collection organizer

For a DBC project, I have to use Ruby and SQL to 
make a program that takes advantage of persistent data.  And you know what?

I **desperately** need a better way to keep track of my comics.

I own probably ~1000 single issues, including several hundred X-Men comics.  Independent of the fact that none of my friends are going to want to help me move, there are a few problems with this.  First of all, just with that number, it's obviously hard to keep track of individual items.  And it's hard in two senses: it's hard to remember what I have, and when I try to make lists to remember, it's a laborious process entering one item at a time.

The second big problem is that if I want to know if I own *Uncanny X-Men 267* I have to scroll through a hard-to-read list to see if it's missing (looking at the cover I think I *might* have it).  Even if I take the time to make a dedicated list of things I'm missing, that list will also be hard to read, and will be prone to at least twice the amount of human error.

So the **gutterz**, affectionately named for the space between comic panels (while also being a nod to the fact that I need to get my comic organization act cleaned up) has two big goals I'm aiming for:

1. I want it to be easier to enter issues of comics, with meta-data, in bulk, in several different ways.

2. I want to be able to easily search whether or not I have an issue.

I might add some more features and some might just emerge from how I set up the database.  But these are my initial thoughts on **gutterz**.
