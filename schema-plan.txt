Every comic book will need the following attributes:

COMIC BOOK
~~~~
Title*
Issue number
Author*
Artist*
(Maybe Colorist* if I want to get granular)
Publisher*
Publishing schedule*
Years** (see note)
Face value*** (see note)
Genre*

Each category marked with one star will need its own table since it will bear a one-to-many relationship to each comic.  I don't know the best practice for handling instances of multiple authors or artists.  My gut feeling right now is that if an issue has multiple authors, I add a row to the author table dedicated to a string containing both authors, and I could work with a string splitter on "," in Ruby in order to check for multiple authors/artists when necessary.

TITLE
~~~~
Name
Year start
Year finish
**NOTE: Comics are dumb and otherwise identical titles have distinct publishing runs demarcated by parenthetical years of origin (X-Men 196x and X-Men 201x are distinct titles).  I think this is the best way to handle publishing years, since it will also allow me to help myself to the start year for each title.

AUTHOR
